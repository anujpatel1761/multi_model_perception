dataset.py
This file handles loading the synchronized data from KITTI:
- Functions to find corresponding files across modalities
- Camera image loading and basic preprocessing
- LiDAR point cloud loading from binary files
- Calibration file parsing
- Batch processing for multiple frames

calibration_utils.py
This file contains all the transformation logic:
- Parse KITTI calibration files (extracting matrices)
- Functions to convert between coordinate systems:
  - LiDAR to camera transformations
  - 3D to 2D projections
  - Rectification calculations

feature_extraction.py
This file handles extracting features from both sensors:
- Camera feature extraction (edges, textures, CNN features)
- LiDAR feature extraction (geometric features, height maps)
- Feature normalization functions
- Spatial alignment of features

fusion.py
This file implements your feature-level fusion strategies:
- Grid-based or region-based fusion methods
- Feature concatenation/combination algorithms
- Weighted fusion implementations
- Post-fusion processing
